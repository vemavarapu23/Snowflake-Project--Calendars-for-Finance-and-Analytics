# ❄️ Snowflake Project: Calendars for Finance and Analytics

### Cloud Data Platform (Snowflake) and Advanced SQL Modeling

This project demonstrates proficiency in building robust data pipelines and performing data modeling within the **Snowflake** cloud data warehouse. This project utilized publicly available datasets accessed directly via the **Snowflake Data Marketplace** to ensure realistic data inputs. The core objective is to create standardized dimension tables (date/calendar tables) essential for financial reporting and analytics.

## Key Objectives:
* **Cloud Data Sourcing:** Demonstrate accessing and querying external datasets directly from the **Snowflake Data Marketplace**.
* **SQL Transformation (ELT):** Utilize complex SQL commands (e.g., CREATE TABLE AS, date functions, conditional logic) to generate and populate a standardized date and time dimension table.
* **Data Modeling:** Create structured tables designed to support common financial queries, such as linking transactions to fiscal periods, quarters, and business days.
* **Data Integrity:** Ensure the consistency and accuracy of the date data, which is critical for all time-series analysis and reporting.

## Tools Used:
* Snowflake (Cloud Data Platform, Virtual Warehouses)
* Snowflake Data Marketplace (Data Sourcing)
* SQL (DDL and DML commands)
